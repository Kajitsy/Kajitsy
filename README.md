# Hi, everybody, I'm Kajitsy.

I'm, uh, well, kind of a person who wants to learn coding..... I live in Russia, please don't think of it as a bad thing.


### Yeah, I haven't done anything special yet, but I've made some contributions to the following repositories:

- [GUI/Lite forks](https://github.com/Kajitsy/Soul-of-Waifu-Fork) for [Soul of Waifu](https://github.com/jofizcd/Soul-of-Waifu) 
- Russian translation for [Collapse Launcher](https://github.com/CollapseLauncher/Collapse)
 - I also have my own browser extensions, right now only Firefox... whatever, [Genshin Star Rail CodeEntter](https://github.com/Kajitsy/Genshin-Star-Rail-CodeEntter)

I'm also just a Genshin Impact player with 59 adventure rank :>

### I also have these social networks:
