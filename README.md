# Hi, everybody, I'm Kajitsy.



### Yeah, I haven't done anything special yet, but I've made some contributions to the following repositories:

- [Fork "Emilia"](https://github.com/Kajitsy/Emilia) for [Soul of Waifu](https://github.com/jofizcd/Soul-of-Waifu) 
- Russian translation for [Collapse Launcher](https://github.com/CollapseLauncher/Collapse)
- I also have my own browser extensions, right now only Firefox... whatever, [Genshin Star Rail CodeEntter](https://github.com/Kajitsy/Genshin-Star-Rail-CodeEntter)

I'm also just a Genshin Impact player with 60 adventure rank :>
